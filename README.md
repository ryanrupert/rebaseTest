# Git rebase Test
This is a test repository used for testing out how `git rebase` works.

## Sources
The guide used is from [James Cooke "Git: To squash or not to squash](https://jamescooke.info/git-to-squash-or-not-to-squash.html).
And [César Ferreira "Mastering Git - Why Rebase is amazing"](https://hackernoon.com/mastering-git-why-rebase-is-amazing-a954485b128a) as reference for reapplying commits.

## Instructions
For experimentation (the steps and commands used here are what were used in creating this repository):
1. Create repository
`git init`

2. Create readme file
`vim README.md`

3. Add and commit
```
git add README.md
git commit
```

Now This is broken up into branches that have not diverged and branches that have diverged all in separate files.

[Non-Diverged](./non-diverged.md)
[Diverged](./diverged.md)
